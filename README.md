# Emotions - Emotion contagion model for dynamical crowd path planning

## Description
Emotion contagion model for dynamical crowd path
planning. Realistic and plausible simulation of crowd path planning and crowd behaviour. We want to change the paths considering drive to use the optimal (shortest vs fastest) path of each agent and also modeling their personalities using OCEAN pesonality trait model. The emotions are contagious.

## Starting Point:
Emotion Contagion Model for Dynamical Crowd Path Planning: Yunpeng Wu et al. [link](https://doi.org/10.53941/ijndi.2024.100014}])

## Project stages
* First (26.11.2024)
Working simulation (simplified redo of the article), room, maybe not all parameters, collision avoidance (optional).
Initial project structure: Agent class, Environment class (room), Main class (visualization)

* Second (7.12.2024)
Working simulation from the article. Parallelize agent computations.

* Final (11.1.2025)
Add parameter of panic (=> agressivness) to agents (slows down evacuation)
Use historic data of agent ... (max agressivness until now)
Working simulation
Screens from simulation, and all traces
